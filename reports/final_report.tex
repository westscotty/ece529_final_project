\section{Introduction}
Feature tracking is a fundamental task in computer vision, used for motion estimation, structure-from-motion, and object tracking. The Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) feature tracker is one of the most widely used algorithms for tracking key points in image sequences. Combining Shi-Tomasi's feature detection method with Lucas-Kanade optical flow, it identifies distinctive features and estimates their motion across frames.

In this paper, we delve into the mathematics and principles underpinning the KLT feature tracker. The aim is to offer a comprehensive understanding of the algorithm and highlight its practical applications in computer vision tasks.

\section{Theoretical Background}

\subsection{Feature Detection: The Shi-Tomasi Method}
The Shi-Tomasi method builds upon the Harris corner detection algorithm, identifying points with high intensity variations in multiple directions as "good features to track."

1. \textbf{Gradient Computation}: Compute image gradients \( I_x \) and \( I_y \) using finite differences:
\[
I_x(x, y) = I(x+1, y) - I(x, y), \quad I_y(x, y) = I(x, y+1) - I(x, y).
\]

2. \textbf{Structure Tensor}: For a window \( W \) around each pixel, calculate the structure tensor:
\[
M = \begin{bmatrix}
\sum_W I_x^2 & \sum_W I_x I_y \\
\sum_W I_x I_y & \sum_W I_y^2
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

3. \textbf{Eigenvalue Criterion:} Compute the eigenvalues \( \lambda_1 \) and \( \lambda_2 \) of \( M \). A pixel is selected as a feature if:
\[
R = \min(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) > \text{threshold}.
\]

\subsection{Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow}
Lucas-Kanade assumes that the motion of a pixel is small and approximately constant within a neighborhood. The brightness constancy assumption is used:
\[
I(x, y, t) = I(x+u, y+v, t+1).
\]

Expanding using a Taylor series:
\[
I(x+u, y+v, t+1) \approx I(x, y, t) + u \cdot I_x + v \cdot I_y + I_t.
\]

Rewriting:
\[
I_x u + I_y v = -I_t.
\]

For a window \( W \), this becomes a system of equations:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum_W I_x^2 & \sum_W I_x I_y \\
\sum_W I_x I_y & \sum_W I_y^2
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\ v
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
-\sum_W I_t I_x \\
-\sum_W I_t I_y
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

The solution is:
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
u \\ v
\end{bmatrix}
=
M^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
-\sum_W I_t I_x \\
-\sum_W I_t I_y
\end{bmatrix}.
\]

\section{Algorithmic Implementation}

The KLT feature tracker combines feature detection and optical flow estimation. The algorithm can be summarized as:

1. \textbf{Feature Detection}: Use the Shi-Tomasi method to identify \"good features to track"

2.  \textbf{Optical Flow Estimation}: For each feature, estimate motion using the Lucas-Kanade method.

3. \textbf{Handling Large Motions}: Use image pyramids to track features across different resolutions.

4. \textbf{Feature Loss}: Reinitialize the tracker if features are lost or drift significantly.

\section{Experimental Setup}

To evaluate the KLT feature tracker, we conducted experiments using real-world video sequences. The algorithm was implemented using OpenCV, and results were compared with ground truth motion data.

\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset included sequences with varying lighting conditions, motion patterns, and textures.

\subsection{Performance Metrics}
Performance was measured using:

1. \textbf{Accuracy}: The Euclidean distance between tracked points and ground truth.
2. \textbf{Robustness}: The percentage of features successfully tracked over time.

\section{Results and Discussion}

The results demonstrated that the KLT tracker performs well under moderate motion and lighting changes. However, challenges arose in:
- Tracking points in low-texture regions.
- Handling occlusions and large displacements.

\section{Conclusion}
The KLT feature tracker is a powerful tool for motion estimation and feature tracking. By combining Shi-Tomasi's feature detection with Lucas-Kanade optical flow, it achieves robustness and efficiency. Future work will focus on improving performance in challenging scenarios.
